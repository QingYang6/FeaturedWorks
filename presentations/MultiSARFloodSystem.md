      A novel design that initializes the industrialization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based operational flood mapping. The fusion of automatic trigger, satellite tasking, multi-source SAR data utilization, self-supervised algorithm, and cloud computing, consolidated teamwork has elevated the system to the real-world operational level. Now hydrologists would have flood inundation footages that penetrate the cloud, regardless of day or night.
