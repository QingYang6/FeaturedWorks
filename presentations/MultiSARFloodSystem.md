      A novel design that initalizes the industrilization of Sythetic Apeture Radar(SAR)-based operational flood mapping. The fusion of automatic trigger, satellite tasking, multi-source SAR data ultilization, self-supervised algorithm, cloud computing, and consolidated team work lead by NOAA NESDIS has elevated the system to the real-word operational level. Now hydrologists would have flood inundation footages that penatrate the cloud, regardless day or night.
